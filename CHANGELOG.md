# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Building

- The sim reads each city's command stream and applies `build` and `demolish` before
  the next tick. Every command is recorded as a `command` event with a hash of who
  sent it and a result, in the district it touched, beside the `built` or
  `demolished` event it caused. A refused command is recorded with its reason and
  changes nothing.
- The `speed` command sets the city's speed and resumes a paused city. The loopback
  endpoint stays for operators.
- `place road`, `zone` and `fork` are refused as unsupported for now.
- The page's fold follows `road` events and a keyframe's road list.
- `dev/check-commands.mjs` publishes commands as a mayor from a plain client; the
  dev-stack CI job runs it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-24

The first release: a generated city that runs live in the browser on Felix. It
covers the look and the first milestone, a live city.

### The look

- A style frame for the art direction, with day and night renders.
- An asset pipeline that builds colormap variants once per pack.
- Daylight as one function of the hour, with staggered windows and lamps.
- Post processing as a pass list that a quality tier can trim.
- Quality tiers chosen from frame time, and a frame-time HUD.

### The city

- City generation from a seed, and a layout with arterials, varied blocks and
  land-value zoning.
- Residents, schedules and routing.
- Records for tick, keyframe, command and registry, encoded the same in the sim
  and the browser.

### The sim

- The sim steps a city and commits one record per district per tick, with an
  hourly keyframe.
- City speed: pause, 4, 8 or 16 ticks a second.

### The live city

- A development stack of Felix, the gateway, a stand-in sign-in provider, the sim
  and the web app, started with `dev/up.sh` under Docker or Podman.
- The browser draws the city live, with cars and walkers moving in time with the
  sim.
- A loading screen that fills in district by district, a `Reconnecting…` pill, and
  catch-up from the log after a dropped connection.
- A registry of cities and a city picker.

### Release

- Images `ghcr.io/getfelix/felix-metro-sim` and `felix-metro-web` for amd64 and
  arm64, a compose bundle that runs them, and the built web app.

Built on Felix 0.6.0 and felix-gateway 0.7.0.
